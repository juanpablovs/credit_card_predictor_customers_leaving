# Predictor of customers leaving a credit card for a major retail bank

Hi,

This is part of a project that I completed for a customer that needed to predict customer defection rates of one of its products.

By knowing the percentage of customers that would defect, the customer could undertake counter measures and deploy incentives to these customers to reduce this rate.

The project went very well, and the algorithm was quite useful.

I thought that someone might need something like this so I have included the file that computes the algorithm in the form of a regression that includes the associated error (RMSE).

If you are reading this, I sincerely hope that it is useful to you.
